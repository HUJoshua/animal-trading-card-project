                    Rabbits of the Angora breed are known for their beautiful appearance. They are calm and friendly in nature. These rabbits are adorned with fur. Their entire body -including the face- is covered with wool. The only wool-free areas are the feet and the area above the nose. They are widely used as pet and are also used for Angora wool production.
